# The Colonel Blotto Game

## Overview
This project is a single-player strategy game inspired by the **Colonel Blotto** game.  
A human player (“Player”) allocates a fixed number of troops across multiple castles, while an AI opponent (“Colonel”) chooses its own allocation in response. The side that wins the most points wins the round.

The game is implemented in **R using Shiny**.

## Core Gameplay
- There are **5 castles**.
- Both Player and Colonel must allocate **all 100 troops** across the castles.
- Each castle is won by the side allocating more troops to that castle.
